# plant-tracker
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This is a project of a 3D box that contains features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Measure and display temperature and humidity, soil and air moisture, sunlight level for a plant on screen</li>
  <li>Users can click a button to switch between these information on screen</li>
  <li>Users can view whether the plant needs water or not</li>
  <li>When moisture goes below a threshold, it will draw water from a container (that user has to refill) to water the plant</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tools</h2>
<p><b>Arduino Hardware</b>: temperature and humidity sensor, soil humidity sensor, breadboard, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), wires, water pumper, transformers, battery, resistors</p>
<p><b>Other Components</b>: water containers, water pipe, a plant, battery case
<p><b>Language & Application</b>: C++ (program code), Tinkercad (3D box design)</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Pumper pumps large amount of water that result in overflow</li>
  <li>The box cannot be left outside due to the wire and potential risk related to battery</li>
  <li>It currently requires a connected source, thus cannot be left outside in the garden (can only work with small plant)</li>
</ul>
